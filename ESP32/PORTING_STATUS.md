# Doom RPG ESP32 CYD porting status

Authoritative recovery/status file for the classic ESP32-2432S028R port. Repository state wins over chat history. Serial logs from the real classic CYD are the final runtime authority.

## Current Git boundary

```text
current origin/main = 9e009c0acbb5185afe6d9cc7eeb9dfa02eeea948
branch = fix/inventaire
branch code head = 5c2e2c6805a5da4b0ee1da40c09dd3155cfe41df
local esp32-cyd build = SUCCESS
static RAM = 47544 B
flash = 749913 B
hardware status = HUB REDESIGN + FEEDBACK COEXISTENCE FOCUSED REAL-CYD SMOKE PASS
broader gameplay progression = pending
```

This branch redesigns the compact native in-game HUB and hardens reversible
touch feedback against large modal targets and concurrent framebuffer overlays.
The user exercised the new menu and accepted the post-fix first-door behavior,
but explicitly did not test substantially farther into the game. Do not promote
this boundary to an exhaustive gameplay regression pass.

### In-game HUB redesign — focused REAL-CYD smoke pass

The current HUB is:

```text
INV | WPN | STAT | SYS
```

`INV` uses a centered three-card list. `WPN` is a complete 3x3 grid for normal
weapon IDs 0..8; familiar IDs 9..11 remain excluded. The weapon icon loader now
converts source BGR565 palettes to framebuffer RGB565, fixing the red Fire
Extinguisher and yellow-handled Axe presentation. `STAT` is read-only and no
longer covered by checkpoint controls. `SYS` owns full-width SAVE/LOAD cards,
two-step `SAVE?` / `LOAD?` confirmation and `NO SAVE` handling.

All four tabs are directly touch-addressable. The HUB temporarily owns a full
industrial top title bar and reconstructs the permanent gameplay HUD on close.
The 28-byte HUB owner and world/turn gating remain unchanged.

Two hardware failures were reproduced and fixed during the smoke pass:

```text
large 128x21 LOAD target -> 597 edits exceeded old 512-entry feedback owner
pickup flash/message + SELECT -> legitimate framebuffer drift failed full-FNV restore
```

The feedback owner is now bounded at 768 edits. Overlay creation failure is
nonfatal, and restoration is pixel-owned: a pixel is restored only if it still
contains the value written by touch feedback; newer overlays win. Full-frame
drift outside the touch overlay is diagnostic, not fatal.

Detailed record:

- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_HUB_REDESIGN.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_HUB_REDESIGN.md)

The final redesigned SAVE/LOAD execution paths and broader progression beyond
the first door still require a deliberate regression run.

### Previous facing-label boundary retained

The merged base restores one bounded legacy HUD behavior without changing the
permanent ESP32-native memory architecture.

### Facing-entity top-bar label — REAL-CYD PASS

Legacy `DoomCanvas_checkFacingEntity()` performs a short forward trace after a
settled pose. `Hud_drawTopBar()` then uses the current entity definition name
only as the lowest-priority gameplay fallback:

```text
timed HUD message
 > statBarMessage
 > logMessage
 > facingEntity->def->name (eType != 9)
 > empty
```

The native recovery is pointer-free. It keeps one 34-byte derived owner for the
current target and reads only that target's historical 16-byte EntityDef name
from `/entities.db` through the existing PAK-backed catalog. No map-wide name
table and no legacy `Entity_t*` ownership were introduced.

Recovered trace shape:

```text
origin = player center shifted 31 units forward
reach = 3 tile steps
shared-tile ordering = legacy linked order
line entities = supported
type 9 = trace blocker / no displayed label
```

Real-CYD witnesses include:

```text
Civilian  -> source=sprite index=19 distance=1
Computer  -> source=line   index=279 distance=2 then distance=1
Door      -> source=line   index=275 distance=3
empty     -> active=0 display=0 followed by FACINGLABEL CLEAR
```

The same run proved that closing the HUB restores the world with the existing
`Civilian` facing label intact, and pure rotation retargets the label while
`MONSTERTURN ROTATE-NO-TURN` remains unchanged.

Hardware runtime remained alive at the supplied steady witness:

```text
heap=81936
heap8=16384
largest8=11764
```

Detailed record:

- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_FACING_LABEL.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_FACING_LABEL.md)

### Previous V7/Automap boundary retained

The merged `main` base already contains the validated V7 Automap checkpoint
persistence, minimal neon-blue top-HUD touch locators and standalone
first-weapon acquisition help dialog. Those remain part of the hardware-proven
baseline and are not modified by this milestone.

### Next bounded frontier

Before merging, complete the focused HUB regression checklist: both two-step
checkpoint operations, `NO SAVE`, repeated open/close, rapid tab navigation and
continued play beyond the first door. After merge, recover the exact new `main`
SHA and keep future behavior owner-by-owner and fail-closed where semantics are
not yet migrated.

## Permanent architecture / hard invariants

```text
Doom RPG original data/behavior
 -> ESP32-native parsers/catalogs
 -> compact immutable EspMapRuntime
 -> small explicit mutable owners
 -> native event/script engine
 -> native gameplay
 -> native renderer
```

```text
board       = ESP32-2432S028R classic CYD
MCU         = ESP32-D0WD-V3 dual core 240 MHz
flash       = 4 MB
PSRAM       = none
framebuffer = 160x120 RGB565 = 38400 B
shapeData   = NULL
mediaTexels = NULL
```

Do not reintroduce map-wide legacy texels, pointer-heavy desktop ownership, runtime ZIP dependence for migrated gameplay/map data, or map-wide decompression. `/DoomRPG-ESP32.pak` is the native backing store.

Gameplay/input and rendering stay decoupled. Doom RPG is turn-based; do not optimize `PlatformVideo_present()` prematurely.

## Native asset backing — hardware PASS

Active gameplay storage path:

```text
/DoomRPG-ESP32.pak on microSD
 -> requested-map raw internal-flash slot
 -> 19 KiB resident RAM cache
 -> native gameplay / renderer
```

Preparation API:

```text
EspAssetPack_mapFlashPrepare(targetMapId)
```

Entrance raw-slot witness:

```text

```

## Entrance canonical witness

```text

sourceBytes = 21823
crc32 = 623f34e4
sourceFNV = d5cc751f

sprites = 344
events = 93

```

Retained fresh-map fingerprints:

```text
mapStateFNV = cd99b98e
scriptFNV   = f9e3d9df
lineFNV     = e5e74861
textureFNV  = f1fc1875
automapFNV  = 669b1aa7
topologyFNV = 3f321e43
```

The save-v3 hardware mirror test also captured a deliberately mutated script snapshot with `scriptFNV=f9e59e9f`; this is a checkpoint-state fingerprint, not a replacement for the canonical fresh-map `f9e3d9df` above.

Resident cache baseline:

```text
owner = 23592 B
payload = 19456 B
range records = 288 x 12 B
resident entry slots = 24
large exact range = 2048 B
```

## Current hardware-owned gameplay frontier

Hardware-proven native behavior includes movement/turn/strafe, rotation-in-place without gameplay/monster turn advancement, collision/topology, event-first SELECT, bounded event/script families, dialog, regular doors, hardware-proven pure multi-line SELECT door batches and dynamic lines, mutable line textures, player state/resources, pickups, hazards, native weapon rendering/control/combat, outgoing player damage text plus bounded attack-frame blood spray, compact monster state/position/activation/movement/attack families, type-12/subtype-2 crate combat with exact transform RNG and transformed-pickup projection, the four-page HUB `INV/WPN/STAT/SYS`, raw-flash backing, bounded V7 checkpoint save/load from both HUB and the main menu, resource consumed-overlay persistence, mutable script/event-state persistence, mutable line open/locked + texture-variant persistence, V5 action-owned removed-sprite persistence, V6 crate-transform persistence, V7 Automap reveal persistence, checkpoint-resume HUD/cache/input rearm, HUB/world framebuffer ownership gating for transient action feedback, and the bounded native Automap core with live movement, visited-cell reveal, render-derived thin delimiters, pickup ownership retention and SELECT door interaction while the map owns the framebuffer.

The player root remains:

```text
EspNativeGameplayPlayerState = 52 B
```

The HUB root remains:

```text
EspNativeGameplayHubView = 28 B
pages = INV | WPN | STAT | SYS
WPN = complete 3x3 normal arsenal, source BGR565 converted to RGB565
SYS = dedicated two-step SAVE/LOAD checkpoint page
world dispatch blocked while HUB active
turn advance disabled while HUB active
```

## Main-menu Load Game — REAL-CYD PASS

The CYD main-menu presentation is now:

```text
0 Start Game
1 Load Game
2 Options
3 Help/About
```

The original J2ME `Exit` row is gone. Double-tap confirmation on `Load Game`
calls the shared native checkpoint service. A readable V1-V7 record rebuilds
the immutable BSP, restores its versioned mutable owners and configures the
resume session directly in `ST_PLAYING`, without replaying the intro.

A missing or invalid record is fail-closed: the menu stays active, the selected
row displays red `No Save`, and its runtime framebuffer witness is rebased so
the menu remains interactive. The user confirmed both successful resume and
the no-save response on the real CYD at `18c1cfb`.

Detailed record:

- [`MILESTONE_MAIN_MENU_LOAD.md`](MILESTONE_MAIN_MENU_LOAD.md)

## Native checkpoint save/load v1 — REAL-CYD PASS

The original one-slot checkpoint established the permanent bounded save path:

```text
/sd/DoomRPG-ESP32.sav
magic = DRPGSAV1
version = 1
recordBytes = 132
atomic write = temp + verify + backup rename + commit rename + verify
```

V1 persists immutable BSP identity, full settled `EspPlayerViewState`, full `EspNativeGameplayPlayerState`, player/runtime fingerprints and CRC32. It never serializes pointers or a desktop object graph.

The final load reprime restores the semantic HUD owners directly after the saved settled view is reconstructed:

```text
[NATIVESAVE] REPRIME-HUD ... refresh=pending clear=ready mutation=owners-only turn=no
```

V1 hardware validation proved exact player/pose rollback and repeated-load stability, but map-local mutable owners were rebuilt fresh.

## Native checkpoint save/load v2 resources — REAL-CYD PASS

V2 preserves the exact proven v1 core and adds only one explicit pointer-free section:

```text
magic = DRPGSAV2
version = 2
recordBytes = 276
v1 read compatibility = retained
EspNativeGameplayPlayerResourcesSnapshot = bounded fixed section
max consumed payload = 128 B / 1024 sprites
Entrance used payload = 43 B / 344 sprites
```

The section persists only the semantic consumed-resource overlay plus explicit identity:

```text
sourceArenaFNV1a
spriteCount
consumedCount
consumedBytes
targetMapId
consumedBits[]
```

Hardware validation proved both directions:

```text
resource consumed before SAVE -> remains absent after LOAD
resource consumed after SAVE -> reappears after LOAD
```

The proof was exercised with Armor Shards and a Small Medkit through the normal native topology/render path, not merely as restored bookkeeping.

## Native checkpoint save/load v3 script — REAL-CYD PASS

V3 keeps the v1 core and v2 resource section and appends exactly one compact `EspMapScriptStateSnapshot`:

```text
magic = DRPGSAV3
version = 3
recordBytes = 808
v1/v2 read compatibility = retained
write format = v3
script snapshot max payload = 512 B
```

The script section persists pointer-free semantic bytes only:

```text
sourceArenaFNV1a
eventCount
byteCodeCount
eventStateBytes
removedCommandBytes
storageBytes
storage[] = packed event states + removed-command bits
```

Entrance uses:

```text
events = 93
byteCodes = 265
script storage = 81 B
```

The snapshot/restore API validates runtime identity, exact counts/sizes and unused tail bytes, restores only into the freshly rebuilt native script owner, and verifies the restored semantic fingerprint before session configure. Corrupt or incompatible sections fail closed.

The final hardware mirror SAVE captured already-mutated event state and three consumed resources:

```text
[NATIVESAVE] SAVE ... version=3 bytes=808
             pos=160,1504 angle=64
             playerFNV=549e6620 runtimeFNV=c3882516
             recordCrc=dc35a833
             resources=3/43B sprites=344
             script=93/265/81B scriptFNV=f9e59e9f
             atomic=temp+backup+rename
             world=resources+script-restored+others-fresh
```

Gameplay then diverged after SAVE by consuming a Bullet Clip and Fire Ext; live state reached `playerFNV=a6e115a7`, weapon 1, weapons `0006`, ammo0=10, ammo1=12 and five consumed resources.

LOAD restored the exact checkpoint:

```text
[PLAYERRES] READY ... playerFNV=549e6620
[PLAYERRES] RESTORE ... consumed=3 bytes=43
[NATIVESAVE] LOAD ... version=3 bytes=808
             pos=160,1504 angle=64
             playerFNV=549e6620
             resources=restored/3/43B
             script=restored/93/265/81B/f9e59e9f
             world=resources+script-restored+others-fresh
[ENGINESESSION] HUD ... hp=30/30 armor=8/20 weapon=2 ammo=8
```

The strongest semantic witness came immediately after LOAD: event 79, which had been completed **before** SAVE, remained ineligible instead of reopening:

```text
[MOVEEVENT] EXIT-PREFLIGHT ... tile=738 ... status=NO_ELIGIBLE event=79 eligible=0 ...
[MOVEEVENT] EXIT ... tile=738 ... status=NO_ELIGIBLE event=79 eligible=0 ...
```

Together with the earlier opposite-direction test where post-SAVE dialog/event mutations were rolled back and became executable again, V3 proves:

```text
script/event mutation after SAVE -> rolled back by LOAD
script/event mutation before SAVE -> preserved by LOAD
```

Detailed record:

- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V3_SCRIPT.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V3_SCRIPT.md)

### Historical v3 world boundary (superseded by V4)

Persisted:

```text
settled player pose
EspNativeGameplayPlayerState
EspNativeGameplayPlayerResources consumed overlay
EspMapScriptState event states + removed-command bits
```

Still intentionally fresh / not yet persisted:

```text
line open/locked state
line texture variants
automap reveal state
monster mutable state/positions/activation/combat consequences
destructibles
gameplay RNG state
```

Continue save persistence owner-by-owner. Never replace this with a monolithic world/object dump.

Long-session hardware steady point observed during the V3 validation:

```text
heap8 = 17724
largest8 = 8692
```

This remained stable across the final LOAD/replay segment. Fragmentation/headroom remains below the advisory target and should stay on the review list, but the run does not demonstrate a new per-LOAD leak.

## Native checkpoint save/load v4 lines — REAL-CYD PASS

V4 keeps the proven v1/v2/v3 semantic sections and appends one compact line-family snapshot:

```text
magic = DRPGSAV4
version = 4
recordBytes = 1212
v1/v2/v3 read compatibility = retained
write format = v4
line count max = 1024
line bitset max = 128 B
Entrance lines = 480
Entrance bitset bytes = 60
```

The section persists only:

```text
open bit per line
locked bit per line
mutable locked/unlocked texture-10 variant bit
runtime identity + exact line count/size
line-state and texture-state fingerprints
```

The real-CYD load first rebuilt canonical Entrance line owners at `locked=7`, `texture10=0`, then restored the saved soldier-door state:

```text
[MAPLINECHECKPOINT] RESTORE ... lines=480 bytes=60
                    open=0 locked=6 texture10=1
                    lineFNV=69334d90 textureFNV=bda09634
[NATIVESAVE] LOAD ... version=4 bytes=1212
             resources=restored/5/43B
             script=restored/93/265/81B/26f291e3
             lines=restored/480/60B/open0/locked6/tex101/69334d90/bda09634
```

After LOAD, line 352 opened normally with `locked=0` without replaying the soldier unlock script:

```text
[ACTION] DOOR line=352 opcode=15 status=OK open=0->1 locked=0 ...
[DOORANIM] COMPLETE ... transaction=committed
```

The first V4 hardware attempt also exposed a `loopTask` stack-canary reset when entering STAT. The final code boundary moved the large read workspace out of the HUB stack, removed large full-record CRC/verification copies, and passed both CI and the real-CYD INV -> STAT -> LOAD sequence without reset.

Detailed record:

- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V4_LINES.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V4_LINES.md)

### Historical v4 world boundary (superseded by V5)

Persisted:

```text
settled player pose
EspNativeGameplayPlayerState
EspNativeGameplayPlayerResources consumed overlay
EspMapScriptState event states + removed-command bits
EspMapLineState open/locked state
EspMapLineTextureState locked/unlocked texture variants
```

Still intentionally fresh / not yet persisted:

```text
automap reveal state
monster mutable state/positions/activation/combat consequences
destructibles
gameplay RNG state
```

Post-LOAD session invariants remained intact:

```text
shapeData == NULL
mediaTexels == NULL
heap8 = 14076
largest8 = 6644
```

## Native checkpoint save/load v5 action removals — REAL-CYD PASS

V5 preserves the proven V1-V4 sections and appends one compact
`EspNativeGameplayActionRemovedSnapshot`:

```text
magic = DRPGSAV5
version = 5
recordBytes = 1356
V1/V2/V3/V4 read compatibility = retained
write format = V5
max removed-sprite payload = 128 B / 1024 sprites
Entrance payload = 43 B / 344 sprites
```

The section owns only the action engine's semantic removed-sprite bitset plus
runtime/map identity and a semantic fingerprint. It does not serialize legacy
entities, renderer objects or a generic mutable world graph.

Real-CYD SAVE witness:

```text
[NATIVESAVE] SAVE ... version=5 bytes=1356
             pos=288,1248 angle=0
             playerFNV=15cb16e4 runtimeFNV=c3882516
             resources=5/43B
             script=93/265/81B scriptFNV=26f291e3
             lines=480/60B open=1 locked=6 texture10=1
             lineFNV=c50b0721 textureFNV=bda09634
             actionRemoved=1/43B/a54be373
```

LOAD rebuilt the immutable Entrance runtime, restored the exact checkpoint
owners and reproduced the same action-removal fingerprint:

```text
[NATIVESAVE] REPRIME-HUD ... refresh=pending clear=ready ...
[PLAYERRES] RESTORE ... consumed=5 bytes=43
[MAPLINECHECKPOINT] RESTORE ... open=1 locked=6 texture10=1
[NATIVESAVE] LOAD ... version=5 bytes=1356
             actionRemoved=restored/1/43B/a54be373
[ENGINESESSION] RESUME checkpoint=restored freshFirstFrame=skipped dynamicLines=gameplay-wrapper
[RESIDENTGAMEPLAY] READY map=current entry=checkpoint-resume ...
[ENGINESESSION] READY ... shapeData=0x0 mediaTexels=0x0
```

The user visually confirmed that the fire cleared before SAVE stayed absent
after LOAD while another fire that had never been cleared remained lit. A
stronger opposite-direction mirror (clear a second fire after SAVE and prove it
returns on LOAD) was not exercised in the supplied log and is not claimed.

The final code boundary is:

```text
d65e5b9be9947e92c700b2296790b003ff7b7df0
esp32-cyd #387 / 35704985512 = SUCCESS
REAL-CYD = PASS
```

### Historical V5 world boundary — superseded by V6/V7

Persisted:

```text
settled player pose
EspNativeGameplayPlayerState
EspNativeGameplayPlayerResources consumed overlay
EspMapScriptState event states + removed-command bits
EspMapLineState open/locked state
EspMapLineTextureState locked/unlocked texture variants
EspNativeGameplayActionEngine action-owned removed-sprite overlay
```

Still intentionally fresh at the V5 boundary:

```text
automap reveal state
monster mutable state/positions/activation/combat consequences
full entity/sprite dynamic state and transformed definitions
destructible transformed state such as crate -> pickup
power-coupling health/death globals
persistent GSprites
ceiling/floor color
other legacy player metadata not yet owned natively
```

Gameplay RNG is rebuilt fresh, but the recovered original save format does not
serialize RNG state, so this is not listed as a missing original-save field.

The current V7 writer additionally persists V6 crate transformations and V7
Automap reveal state. V1-V6 records remain readable and default owners absent
from their version to fresh state.

Detailed records:

- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V5_ACTION_REMOVALS.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V5_ACTION_REMOVALS.md)
- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V6_CRATE_TRANSFORMS.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V6_CRATE_TRANSFORMS.md)
- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V7_AUTOMAP.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_GAMEPLAY_SAVE_LOAD_V7_AUTOMAP.md)

## HUB/action-feedback framebuffer ownership — REAL-CYD PASS

The v2 hardware test exposed an unrelated visual ownership race: a pickup top-bar message could expire while HUB owned the framebuffer, leaving a stale `Got ...` fragment over the MENU area and causing a later underlay mismatch/recover path.

The bounded fix is:

```text
8b7a4c04dee1622954f2ea453ca1b15792fbf6fa
  ESP32: pause action feedback while HUB owns framebuffer
5a1020fd5d160c111ff09ecb8a480f37ea8d0578
  ESP32: gate world feedback service behind HUB ownership
CI #267 = SUCCESS
```

The timer remains based on real elapsed time, but world feedback/viewport-flash restore work is blocked while HUB owns the framebuffer. The user reproduced the original pickup-message/HUB sequence on the real CYD and confirmed the stale fragment is gone. Therefore `5a1020fd5d160c111ff09ecb8a480f37ea8d0578` is a hardware-valid code boundary for this ownership fix.

## CHANGEMAP code boundary — candidate, hardware exit test still pending

Entrance event 1 / tile 69 is owned by the branch transition path:

```text
SAVEGAME -> /junction.bsp, targetMapId 9, savePos 992,1888 angle 64
CHANGEMAP -> /junction.bsp, targetMapId 9, showStats 1, spawnParam 0
```

The candidate supports the show-stats WAIT/ACK handoff, resident teardown, target rebuild/spawn and session configure with fail-closed errors. It remains **candidate** until the user performs the dedicated real-CYD level-exit test.

## Native rotation no-turn parity — REAL-CYD PASS

The legacy/J2ME split is now restored:

```text
movement completion -> advances gameplay turn
rotation completion -> updates facing/view only
```

Hardware-tested code boundary:

```text
b548321f477626777800371f0f82a9f3c2375bd9
```

The real-CYD test confirmed that turning in place no longer advances monster behavior. The same supplied hardware run reconfirmed that legitimate turn-producing actions still do:

```text
PLAYER_ATTACK -> [MONSTERTURN] SCHEDULE n=32 reason=PLAYER_ATTACK
MOVE          -> [MONSTERTURN] SCHEDULE n=33 reason=MOVE
MOVE          -> [MONSTERTURN] SCHEDULE n=34 reason=MOVE
MOVE          -> [MONSTERTURN] SCHEDULE n=35 reason=MOVE
```

The correction adds no allocation, gameplay RNG use, topology mutation, renderer mutation or player mutation on rotation. Detailed record:

- [`MILESTONE_NATIVE_ROTATE_NO_TURN.md`](MILESTONE_NATIVE_ROTATE_NO_TURN.md)

## Next bounded milestone

The bounded native Automap core is now hardware-valid. The next major gameplay
candidate is the existing **CHANGEMAP / Entrance level-exit transition**.

Do not expand the scope first. Re-read the merged/main implementation and prove
the smallest complete real-CYD route:

```text
eligible Entrance level-exit event
 -> SAVEGAME / target-position semantics
 -> CHANGEMAP request
 -> optional stats WAIT/ACK handoff
 -> requested-map rebuild
 -> player/view placement
 -> resident gameplay re-arm on target map
```

If the existing CHANGEMAP path is already correct, this can remain primarily a
hardware-validation/docs milestone. If hardware exposes a divergence, constrain
the fix to that transition family.

Automap follow-up parity remains separately bounded: PASS_TURN and other normal
playing actions while Automap is open and hardware execution of `EV_GIVEMAP`.
Automap reveal-state checkpoint persistence is already hardware-proven in V7.

The mixed physical/touch SAVE cursor fix is retained. This branch replaces its
old STAT overlay with the dedicated SYS page; the final two-step SAVE/LOAD paths
still need their focused post-redesign hardware retest.

## Hardware-validated intro display polish

Real-CYD visual validation on code head `0d21332bd2524bca73d5284f70e053ca8ba6430d` confirmed the permanent native intro fit split:

```text
logical framebuffer = 160x120 RGB565
content viewport     = 120x120 centered at x=20
starfield background = 160x120 full width
animated intro scene = 160x120 full width
story text           = 156x120 centered at x=2
extra framebuffer    = 0 B
```

The dedicated animated intro scene now maps its starfield/layers/planet/spaceship/line geometry across the full logical display, while ordinary story-page decoration remains in the aspect-preserving 120x120 content viewport. Story glyphs use the separately tuned 156-pixel soft-wide horizontal mapping.

The real-CYD visual verdict for this exact split was PASS ("Superbe"). The production geometry witness is:

```text

CI for the hardware-tested head retained the canonical no-PSRAM static-RAM boundary:

No second framebuffer or frame-sized staging allocation was introduced.

## Hardware-validated pure multi-line SELECT door batch

Real-CYD validation on `/intro.bsp` proved the bounded pure-door batch path used by the hidden/secret door.

The SELECT hit tile `195`, event `10`, whose complete command sequence is exactly two eligible `EV_OPENLINE` commands:

```text
[ACTION] SELECT seq=139 status=DOOR_OK tile=195 event=10 eligible=2 unsupported=0
[DOORANIM] SNAP line=471 open=0->1 flags=00000928 reason=non-regular-door
[DOORANIM] SNAP line=470 open=0->1 flags=00001110 reason=non-regular-door
[ACTION] DOOR-BATCH event=10 count=2 status=OK [0]line=471/op=15/open=0->1/removed=0->1 [1]line=470/op=15/open=0->1/removed=0->1
[RESIDENTGAMEPLAY] SELECT n=10 seq=139 doors=2 firstDoor=471 committed=yes redraw=yes collision=live animation=bounded-batch sound=deferred entityRelink=deferred turnAdvance=deferred
[DYNAMICLINES] FRAME angle=64 open=4 adaptedReads=6 animatedReads=0 textureVariants=0 render=ok immutableRuntime=yes
```

Both lines are non-regular door geometry, so the native animator intentionally reports `SNAP` rather than scheduling the four-frame regular-door animation. The line-state transaction still commits both open bits and both remove-if-handled command bits atomically.

Walking through the opened secret-door tile then sees the event as exhausted:

```text
[MOVEEVENT] ENTER-PREFLIGHT ... tile=195 ... status=NO_ELIGIBLE event=10 eligible=0 ...
[MOVEEVENT] EXIT-PREFLIGHT ... tile=195 ... status=NO_ELIGIBLE event=10 eligible=0 ...
```

This validates the permanent rule: a SELECT event may execute a **pure** bounded batch of up to eight eligible line commands (`EV_MOVELINE/OPENLINE/CLOSELINE/MOVELINE2`), matching the legacy/native `openDoors[8]` capacity. The complete batch is previewed before mutation; mixed-family events, duplicate-line batches requiring sequential intermediate-state semantics, and batches beyond the bound remain fail-closed.

Hardware runtime after the traversal remained resident and stable in the submitted log:

```text
[ALIVE] ... heap=78832 heap8=13280 largest8=12276 ... MAPPINGS=ready MENUBSP=ready
```

CI for the validated code head retained the canonical static-RAM boundary:

```text
RAM static = 44832 B
```

## Development workflow

```text
recover true main + docs
 -> choose one bounded behavior family
 -> recover exact legacy behavior where relevant
 -> design a small permanent native API/owner
 -> keep different families fail-closed
 -> commit + push agent/*
 -> CI esp32-cyd
 -> test on real CYD
 -> Serial is truth
 -> fix failures directly
 -> after PASS, docs-only tail
 -> merge-ready
```

Never merge into `main` without explicit user request.
